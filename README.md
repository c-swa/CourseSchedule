# CourseSchedule
 Artificial Intelligence Project 2

This assignment will be over Genetic Algorithms. The Readme will contain the project details.

Your assignment is to create a course schedule, where:
* All Courses must be taught.
* One course per room per time slot.
* Each instructor can teach any of the courses
    * However, there is an upper limit on how many courses each instructor can teach.
* Courses in the same semester are preferred to be close in time slots and in the same building.

You are given a list of _12 courses_. You also have a list of several faculty members, and the courses they can teach.
You also have a list of available rooms and time slots. Your task is to use a genetic algorithm to devise a suitable teaching schedule.
